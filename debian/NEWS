libauthen-radius-perl (0.12-1) unstable; urgency=low

  upstream now provides a set of radius dictionaries so that you can use
  this module without having to install extra components of the RADIUS
  server onto your client machine.

  They are not installed into the standard location as in many
  situations they are not required. If they were installed this package
  would conflict with radiusd-cistron and xtradius which is not a good
  thing. They are provided by this package in the directory
  /usr/share/doc/libauthen-radius-perl/raddb. If you need any of these
  dictionaries you should copy the relevant files into somewhere where
  the code using this module can read them. By default the module will
  look for dictionaries in the directory named /etc/raddb/dictionary.
